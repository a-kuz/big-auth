# getUserByToken Function

The `getUserByToken` function is an asynchronous function that retrieves a user from the database using a provided token.

## Parameters

The function accepts the following parameters:

- `d1`: An instance of the `D1Database` object.
- `token`: A string representing the user's token.
- `secret`: A string representing the secret key used for token verification.

## Return Value

The function returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `User` object.

## Functionality

The function performs the following steps:

1. Verifies the provided token using the `jwt.verify` function from the `@tsndr/cloudflare-worker-jwt` module. If the token is invalid, it throws an "invalid token" error.

2. Decodes the verified token using the `jwt.decode` function from the `@tsndr/cloudflare-worker-jwt` module to extract the user ID (`sub`).

3. Prepares a SQL query to select the user from the `users` table in the database where the user ID matches the extracted ID and the `deleted_at` field is null.

4. Executes the query and retrieves the user from the database. If the user does not exist, it throws a "user not found" error.

5. Converts the retrieved user from the database format to the `User` object format using the `User.fromDb` method.

6. If any error occurs during the execution of the above steps, it logs the error and throws a "Failed to retrieve or insert user by token" error.

## Errors

The function throws the following errors:

- "invalid token": If the provided token is invalid.
- "user not found": If the user does not exist in the database.
- "Failed to retrieve or insert user by token": If any error occurs during the execution of the function.
