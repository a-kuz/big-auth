# Migration: 1700000000-users.sql

This migration script creates a new table in the database named `users`.

## Table: users

The `users` table is structured as follows:

- `id`: A text field of 21 characters. This field is not nullable and serves as the unique identifier for each user.
- `phone_number`: A text field that stores the user's phone number. This field is not nullable.
- `username`: A text field that stores the user's username.
- `first_name`: A text field that stores the user's first name.
- `last_name`: A text field that stores the user's last name.
- `avatar_url`: A text field that stores the URL of the user's avatar.
- `created_at`: An integer field that stores the timestamp of when the user was created.
- `deleted_at`: An integer field that stores the timestamp of when the user was deleted.

## SQL Code

The SQL code for creating the `users` table is as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
	id TEXT(21) NOT NULL,
	phone_number TEXT NOT NULL,
	username TEXT,
	first_name TEXT,
	last_name TEXT,
	avatar_url TEXT,
	created_at INTEGER,
	deleted_at INTEGER
);
```

This script will only create the `users` table if it does not already exist in the database.
